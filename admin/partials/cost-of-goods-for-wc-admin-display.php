                to help you make the most of these reports. You can see not just sales revenue, but also Costs and
                Profits all in one place. Use this information to help you make decisions about how to promote your
                products and services so that your store makes more money!</p>

            <p>Add a Cost of Good to each product, including product variations, so that you can always know what you
                really earned on every order—not just how much you sold. Total costs for each order line item are saved
                at checkout, so even if your costs increase in the future, your total costs are always historically
                accurate.</p>
